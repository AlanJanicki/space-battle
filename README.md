## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot2]](https://zealous-hugle-26c9fa.netlify.app/)

Simple space-battle game, made with vanilla JavaScript. A goal is to shoot and destroy flying enemy ships. For every destroyed enemy, player gets points. When amount of points is big enough, new level is unlocked and enemies become stronger (they get faster and spawn more often).
Game is controlled by the keyboard, therefore it's intended for computers (app scaling for different screen sizes is handled by simple css transform).
